# Understand this repo
There are 2 important files in this repo (in addition to this "readme.txt"):  
* CodeBook.md:  
* run_analysis.R:  

The file CodeBook.md describes:  
1. General definitions for the dataset 'TidyData.txt'  
2. Data and variabls contained in the dataset  
3. Transformations performed to clean up the data  

The run_analysis.R contains all the R scripts used to perform the analysis.  
This script assumes that the data is available and unziped in a folder called "UCI HAR Dataset" in the working directory.
